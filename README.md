moncarlo
========

moncarlo is a framework to build neural network models and inference with HMC neurons.

Currently this project is no longer under development. Feel free to look at the `neurons/hmc.py` code to understand how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo markov chains work.
In those docs/code I've done my best to explain the important parts of how sampling from a Hamiltonian system works. To dive deeper, checkout `Information Theory` by the late David Mackay.
